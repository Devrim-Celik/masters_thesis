    "1. Regarding the Change from undirected to directed: Does that make sense for a BGP assignment? It is kinda crucial. For example one question I have is that many of the nodes have multiple ways to send traffic. And although this makes sense (depending on where traffic comes in from, it might exit somewhere specific), the traffic always enters at the same position, thus will always take only one exit? Maybe it makes sense to add somewhat of a \"pruning\" after making the graph directed, in which only one of the outwards pointing arrows is used; maybe depending on how many hops it takes to get to the destination (i.e, simulate AS_PATH feature in BGP decision process). --> I AM PRUNING RIGHT NOW; LETS TALK TO KATARINA\n",

    "2. HUGE PROBLEM: Changing the edges in step 4 sometimes leads to non-connectivity to `victim` for many nodes\n",
