* What happens if attack volume < sum(capabilities)?
* fix error shown in test_distribution_of_attack_flow [PARTLY]
	--> There seems to be something seriously wrong. Approximately 1/4 of the test runs in test_distribution_of_attack_flow result in erros. After adding
	rounding in assert comparison, this value is almost unchanged. It seems, that some of the changed edges are wrong, in the sense that:
		- they are missing
		- they lead no where
		- they come from no where
	HARD PROBLEM ....
