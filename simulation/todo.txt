IN ORDER OF PRIORITY

PRIORITY 1
	* Comment!
		* graph
		* nodes [DONE]
		* route table
		* aux function
		* include mthods in class description?
		* file docstrings
	* statement retractment
	* TODOs
	* Find Bugs from Recordings:
		* type 1: an ally is not there 
		* type 2: the sum of all the allies + vicitm does not add up --> I think fixed
		* type 3: help statements come sometimes weirdly
		* type 4: osciallations still  occur with many allies between them


PRIORITY 2
	* still not 100 % reproducable -> attack over time is different!! starting attack vol too.
	* we can have negative probabilities if sum(ally_scrubbing) > attack vol ==> limit the value of "distribute_percentages_to_allies" to 1 somehow
	* add scrubbing capabilities to victim -> if arrived_attack_vol / (1-sum(ally_traffic_handling_perc)))*100 < scrubbing capabilites --> CALL Of help?

PRIORITY 3
	* different attack modes
	* router table for victim
	* make it somehow, that victim and allies that are rdy to receive, dont have an active next hop (i.e., all percentage 0)
	-> see generated graph for problem (and in general)




NOTES: Retractment:
* Issue 1: Sometimes Ally disappears and ally takes full load

need function to send directly to others except victim
- new message type -> "other"
	- doesnt get send
- inform other allies, because support goes directly to victim through as path
